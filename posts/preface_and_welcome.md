This is the first post, entry, or article on this site. Actualy, it is really the second; the first is the About page, so please check that out (also, to avoid repeating myself). There, I briefly discuss the heart behind this website, why I wanted to start it, and what I hope to accomplish through it.

Comments are turned off because I don’t see the need for it; I am all open to any feedback provided through the Contact page. It could also be a passage request, an encouraging testimony, or prayer request, whatever–if you send it, I will read it and try my best to respond.

To God be all the glory!
