Passage: Isaiah 40:22

> It is He who sits above the circle of the earth,  
> And its inhabitants are like grasshoppers,  
> Who stretches out the heavens like a curtain  
> And spreads them out like a tent to dwell in.

I saw this interactive Flash demo of the [Scale of the Universe](https://htwins.net/scale2/) on [Challies’ A La Carte post for 2/13](http://www.challies.com/a-la-carte/a-la-carte-213-2) and thought of this verse that talks about the immensity of God.
