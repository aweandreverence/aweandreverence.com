Introduction:
============= 
Awe and Reverence (A&R) is a software company dedicated to build a God-glorifying, for-profit (read: sustainable), for-Kingdom benefit, cutting-edge Christian software company.

In pursuit of that, our founder ([Jon Tsai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jontsai/)) started an co-op/internship model at A&R to train aspiring Christian Software engineers to equip them with  tangible skills to succeed in their craft.  In the SF Bay Area there is an ever-increasing number of people coming out of bootcamps and trying to transition into Software roles from other industries but unfortunately,that train has left about 3-4 years ago where companies might give these bootcamp grads a chance, many people are now struggling to find employment after these bootcamps.

Jon has mentored dozens of engineers over the years and through the Maskil co-op/internship has provided a post-bootcamp onboarding experience for more junior engineers to get real world, collaborative, team experience. Several of them have gone on to full-time software engineering roles and are jr, mid, sr-level engineers at household name tech companies.

Not only will you gain invaluable experience, you you'll be paid for your work! Each feature/ task will have a bounty with a dollar amount associated with it. The  larger the feature/ task the larger the bounty. We don't believe in muzzling the ox here.

The first project that A&R has  been focused on is called Maskill; envisioned to be the FIRST EVER digital hymnal and worship study Bible. (Imagine every worship song, every language, with (Rap)Genius-style inline annotations and two-way links to Bible passages). Currently Maskil has over 1000 songs in English, 650+ songs in Korean and counting.

- Django
- React
- MySql
